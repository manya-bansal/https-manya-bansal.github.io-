description = """I am an undergraduate student studying Mathematics at Stanford University. Somewhere along the way, 
I took a computer science class and have become a permanent resident of the systems community. 

I am generally interested 
in building designing extensible, productive and composable languages (and tools!) for heterogeneous systems. 
At Stanford, I have been fortunate to work with [Fredrik Kjolstad](http://fredrikbk.com/) and [Dawson Engler](https://web.stanford.edu/~engler/).
